The findstars service can be implemented using the system arguments in which case both the point defined in the program can be made to be
a command line arguement that can be give by the user as a query and then accordingly the number of nearest stars as well.
This way the entire dataset can be read into the memory and then the data can be read each time with a different point that can be queried
as well as the number of nearest stars that are required (k).
