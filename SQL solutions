--- Solution 1:

select * from
(select c.name , o.order_date, rank() over (partition by c.name, o.order_Date order by o.order_date DESC) as Rank
FROM customers c inner join orders o
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
) AS Inner
Where Rank = 1;


--- Solution 2:

select name, order_date, abs(quantity - prev_quantity) as Diff 
from (
select name , order_date, quantity, lag(quantity,1) over (partition by name, order_date order by order_date desc) as prev_quantity
from (select c.name , o.order_date, sum(o.quantity) as quantity
FROM customers c inner join orders o
on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP by c.name , o.order_date) as Inner
where prev_quantity is not null) As outer
order by Diff desc;
