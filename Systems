1. Ranking in terms of latency to first byte arriving in CPU register :
  Read from L2 processor cache
  USB flash storage
  Read from local spinning RAID disk (7200 RPM)
  Read from RAM on neighbour computer in same data center, one hop away
  http API (first hit)
  http s API (first hit)
  Read cloud based Storage (S3, GCS)

a. The parallel upload to S3 buckets would be done using the CLI command for aws S3, i.e. the 'sync' command. The error correction can be 
    done on the files parallely by reading the files using the mmap(memory map) module in python. It does also make sense to use 
    distributed computing mechanism to make sure that the I/O for the files does not take much memory. 
    To measure ideal concurrency there are plenty of platforms such as DataMan that can do the concurrency count and make it as ideal as 
    possible. The  one major advantage of using the tool is that it sees the optimal upload part for all the files and then make sure what 
    amount of part files upload can be done.
